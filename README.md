#### Welcome to Subletter! An application designed to facilitate the subletting process for university students. Gone are the days of posting your sublet on sites like Facebook Marketplace, and receiving dozens of unwanted inquiries from non-students. Subletter ensures that the only people messaging you about your listings are your fellow peers! Features include:
- Posting listings, whether that be items or sublets!
- Messaging other users
- A residences page to make sure you're getting the best deal when you're a sublessee!
- All that and more!

Subletter is built with a MySQL database, Express.js backend, and React.js frontend enhanced by ChakraUI.
